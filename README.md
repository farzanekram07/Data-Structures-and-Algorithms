# 🧠 DSA Learning Journey – Step-by-Step Progress

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository!  
This repo is part of my personal learning journey to build a strong foundation in DSA using **Python**. I’m actively learning and solving problems topic-by-topic while documenting my understanding and observations.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each folder contains:
- ✅ My handwritten/typed notes and explanations
- 💡 Python code examples/solutions
- 🧪 Quizzes or problems (if available)

| # | Topic | Description |
|--:|:------|:------------|
| 1 | [Logic Building](./01_Logic_Building) | Basic logic building through simple problems and patterns |
| 2 | [Complexity Analysis](./02_Complexity_Analysis) | Understanding Time & Space complexities with Big O notation |
| 3 | [Arrays](./03_Arrays) | Linear data structure with constant-time access |
| 4 | [Searching Algorithms](./04_Searching) | Techniques to find elements within data efficiently |
| 5 | [Sorting Algorithms](./05_Sorting) | Organizing data in meaningful order (e.g., bubble, merge, quick sort) |
| 6 | [Hashing](./06_Hashing) | Fast access and retrieval using hash functions |
| 7 | [Two Pointer Technique](./07_Two_Pointer) | Solving problems using two index pointers |
| 8 | [Sliding Window](./08_Sliding_Window) | Optimizing range-based problems using a window of data |

> 🔧 More topics will be added as I progress!
